# RoPro Sandwich Case

The only thing missing from the incredible RoPro keyboard is a "sandwich" layer type case to fill the gap between the top PCB and bottom PCB case (especially if you're running some tasty underglow LED's).

**Please note:**
This project is still currently in development and as soon as it has been fullly tested with the real cut acrylic, the final design files will be released into this repo.

## Materials

The standard RoPro standoffs are 8mm so that's thickness used on this design. LED backlighting seems to look best if you use a diffused acrylic for the case.

## Production

Unless you're balling out of control, getting something laser cut generally speaking is something you'll need to outsource. After a couple of samples, the reccomended places to get it done are listed below.

(If you can personally vouch for another manufacturer, please add them to the list below)

1. Ponoko (US/Worldwide)
2. Cut My Plastic (UK/Worldwide)
