# RoPro Sandwich Case

What is the RoPro?

Shortest and easiest answer is a 75key fully customisable, ortholinear mechanical keyboard that recently completed it's round 1 group buy. The only thing missing from this incredible keyboard is a "sandwich" layer type case to fill the gap between the top PCB and bottom PCB case (especially if you're running some tasty underglow LED's).

For this exact reason, i decided to make one up and release it to the world to cut yourself (if you have the ability), or to send onto a [company](#production) who can do to do the legwork for you.

**Please note:**
This project is still currently in development and as soon as it has been fullly tested with the real cut acrylic, the final design files will be released into this repo.

## [Production](#production)

Unless you're balling out of control, getting something laser cut generally speaking is something you'll need to outsource. After a couple of samples, the reccomended places to get it done are listed below.

(If you can personally vouch for another manufacturer, please add them to the list below)

1. Ponoko (US/Worldwide)
2. Cut My Plastic (UK/Worldwide)

### Best Material?

With the standard RoPro standoffs being 8mm, that's ideally the thickness you want to use to make this design work as intended. However, that being said, you can also use layers to make the same height should you wish.

You could also potentially go a little thicker than 8mm and just have the standoff's sat inside the acrylic layer.

LED backlighting seems to look best if you use a diffused acrylic for the case.
